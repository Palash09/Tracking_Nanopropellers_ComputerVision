# Tracking_Nanopropellers_ComputerVision
In this repository, I have included the code for tracking magnetic nanopropellers which was implemented through computer vision.

The tracking of magnetic nanopropellers was a research project during my internship @ Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.

The process for this project involved an apparatus which was known as microfludic chamber. This apparatus was used to carry
the fluid consisting of nanopropellers over a very short distance and the movement was tracked by a powerful thorlabs camera.

The computer vision technique which was used for this was background subtraction algorithm, this helped in removing the non-moving
parts from the captured part and we can focus on the moving parts itself. With this, we are able to track the movement of the
moving objects in the video.
